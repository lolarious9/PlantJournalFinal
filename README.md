# PlantJournalFinal
Created for the Android Development class I took during Spring 2024. 

The app's purpose is to allow someone to keep track of their plant's care.
I had planned on adding more features, but did not have the time with the other projects.
It allows users to search for and select plants from USDA's list of known plants and add them to their list. The [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/home/downloads) supplies a CSV file that I used to parse the data into the app.
